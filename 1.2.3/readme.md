## Problem Description
> Given a positive integer N, you should output the most right digit of N^N.
 

## Input
> The input contains several test cases. The first line of the input is a single integer T which is the number of test cases. T test cases follow.
 Each test case contains a single positive integer N(1<=N<=1,000,000,000).


## Output
> For each test case, you should output the rightmost digit of N^N.


## Sample Input
  - 2
  - 3
  - 4
    

## Sample Output
  -	7
  -	6

## Hint

>	In the first case, 3 * 3 * 3 = 27, so the rightmost digit is 7.
	In the second case, 4 * 4 * 4 * 4 = 256, so the rightmost digit is 6.
